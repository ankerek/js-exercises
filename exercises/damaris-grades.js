/**
 * Part 1.
 * It's the end of the semester and you got your grades from three classes: Geometry, Algebra, and Physics.
 * 
 * Create a function that:
 * Reads the grades of these 3 classes (Grades range from 0 - 10)
 * Calculate the average of your grades
 * 
 * Example: Geometry = 6, Algebra = 7, Physics = 8
 * 
 *          calculateAverage(6,7,8) -> 7
 * 
 * -------------
 * 
 * Part 2.
 * 
 * The exercise is almost identical to a previous exercise with a minor change. 
 * It's the end of the semester and you got your marks from, Geometry, Algebra, Physics classes. 
 * If the average score is 7 and above print "Good job!", 
 * if the average score is between 6 and 4 print "You need to work harder!", 
 * if the average score is below 4 print "Failed, you really need to work harder!".
 * 
 * Example: Geometry = 6, Algebra = 7, Physics = 8
 * calculageAverage(6,7,8) -> Your average score is 7, Good job!"
